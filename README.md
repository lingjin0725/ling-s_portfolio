## [Project 1: Financial Analysis of College Degrees Using Python](https://github.com/lingjin0725/Python)

This is a project I did for my Data Structures and Algorithms course, where I analyzed the financial outcomes of various undergraduate degrees.  

- Data was taken from the Kaggle dataset 
- Algorithms Used: Hash Table and Binary Search Tree.
- Hashing for fast lookups, BST for ordered storage and retrieval. Optimized the BST traversal and hash table efficiency.
- The Hash Table was the superior data structure for this analysis due to its efficiency.
- Conclusion: This analysis helps students make informed decisions about their education investment based on expected returns by major.

## [Project 2: Flight Delays and Network Analysis with High Dimensional Visualization in R](https://github.com/lingjin0725/nycflights13)

This project was completed for my High-Dimensional Data Learning and Visualization course, where I explored flight delays, network structures, and interactive visualizations using R. 
- Analyzed arrival delays from the nycflights13 dataset.
- Applied mathematical expressions in visualizations for better interpretation.
- Created interactive plots using Plotly and used igraph for network analysis to study social structures.
- Showcased advanced statistical modeling and visualization techniques for interpreting complex data.

## [Project 3: Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation Using R](https://github.com/lingjin0725/R)

This is a project I did for my Statistical Modeling and Data Analytics course, where I analyzed factors influencing student academic performance.  

- Data was taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/856/higher+education+students+performance+evaluation)
- The analysis uses regression and classification techniques. 
- Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors.  
- Explored the impact of socio-economic factors and study habits on cumulative GPA.
- Identified key predictors using feature importance and correlation analysis.

## [Project 4: Car Rental Management System Using Java](https://github.com/lingjin0725/Java)

This project was developed for my Program Design and Development course, focusing on building a Car Rental Management System using Java.  

- Implemented object-oriented programming principles with structured classes for vehicle management, customer handling, and rental processing.  
- Utilized ArrayLists for dynamic inventory management, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.  
- Designed a graphical user interface for intuitive rental processing, real-time inventory tracking, and vehicle returns.
