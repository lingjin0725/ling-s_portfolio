# [Project 1: Financial Analysis of College Degrees Using Python](https://github.com/lingjin0725/Python)

This is a project I did for my Data Structures and Algorithms course, where I analyzed the financial outcomes of various undergraduate degrees.  

- Data was taken from the Kaggle dataset 
- The analysis uses two data structures: Hash Table and Binary Search Tree (BST).  
- Algorithms Used: Hashing for fast lookups, BST for ordered storage and retrieval.  
- Optimized the BST traversal and hash table efficiency.
- Conclusion: The Hash Table was the superior data structure for this analysis due to its efficiency.
