# [Project 1: Financial Analysis of College Degrees Using Python](https://github.com/lingjin0725/Python)

This is a project I completed for my **Data Structures and Algorithms** course, where I analyzed salary data for various undergraduate degrees.  

- **Dataset**: Degrees That Pay Back  
- **Objective**: Identify the undergraduate degree with the **highest mid-career median salary**.  
- **Data Structures Used**:  
  - **Hash Table** – Fast retrieval (O(1)), used for quick salary lookups.  
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – Ordered storage, used to find max salary via rightmost node traversal.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Cleaned data (removed currency symbols, handled missing values).  
  - Stored degree-salary pairs in both data structures.  
  - Retrieved the highest mid-career salary from each.  
- **Results**:  
  - **Top-paying degree**: Chemical Engineering (**$107,000**).  
  - **Best performance**: **Hash Table** (faster than BST).  
- **Conclusion**: The **Hash Table** was the superior data structure for this analysis due to its efficiency.
