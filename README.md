## [Project 1: Financial Analysis of College Degrees Using Python](https://github.com/lingjin0725/Python)

This is a project I did for my Data Structures and Algorithms course, where I analyzed the financial outcomes of various undergraduate degrees.  

- Data was taken from the Kaggle dataset 
- The analysis uses two data structures: Hash Table and Binary Search Tree.  
- Algorithms Used: Hashing for fast lookups, BST for ordered storage and retrieval.  
- Optimized the BST traversal and hash table efficiency.
- Conclusion: The Hash Table was the superior data structure for this analysis due to its efficiency.

## [Project 2: Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation Using R](https://github.com/lingjin0725/R)

This is a project I did for my Statistical Modeling and Data Analytics course, where I analyzed factors influencing student academic performance.  

- Data was taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/856/higher+education+students+performance+evaluation)
- The analysis uses regression and classification techniques. 
- Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors.  
- Explored the impact of socio-economic factors and study habits on cumulative GPA.
- Identified key predictors using feature importance and correlation analysis.

## [Project 3: Car Rental Management System Using Java](https://github.com/lingjin0725/Java)

This project was developed for my Program Design and Development course, focusing on building a Car Rental Management System using Java.  

- Implemented object-oriented programming principles with structured classes for vehicle management, customer handling, and rental processing.  
- Utilized ArrayLists for dynamic inventory management, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.  
- Designed a graphical user interface for intuitive rental processing, real-time inventory tracking, and vehicle returns.
